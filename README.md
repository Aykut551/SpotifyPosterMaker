## Features

-   **Spotify Integration:** Search for albums directly from the Spotify API and fetch their information (album name, artist, tracks, cover art). **Requires Spotify API credentials.**
    
-   **Local File Support:** Load album data from a local JSON file (Spotify API format or similar). You can also upload album cover art from a local image file. **Does NOT require Spotify API credentials.**
    
-   **Customizable Posters:**
    
    -   Create posters in different sizes (A4, A3, A2).
        
    -   Adjust the number of tracks per column for the tracklist.
        
    -   Adjust the horizontal position of the tracklist.
        
    -   Option to include copyright information.
        
-   **Multi-language Support:** Select the language for the application interface. Texts are stored in separate `.lang` files, making it easy to add new languages.
    
-   **Modern GUI:** Interactive and user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
    

## File Structure

The project has the following file and directory structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ fonts/              # Contains font files used for poster drawing.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bold.otf        # Bold font file.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ light.otf       # Light font file.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ medium.otf      # Medium font file.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ regular.otf     # Regular font file.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ semibold.otf    # Semi-bold font file.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ thin.otf        # Thin font file.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ verybold.otf    # Very bold font file.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ verylight.otf   # Very light font file.
â”œâ”€â”€ gui.py              # Contains the Streamlit GUI interface code. This file is run to start the application.
â”œâ”€â”€ lang/               # Directory containing the application's multi-language text files.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ eng.lang        # English language strings.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tr.lang         # Turkish language strings.
â”œâ”€â”€ languages.py        # Python module that loads language strings by reading .lang files in the 'lang' directory.
â””â”€â”€ poster_core.py      # Python module containing the core logic for poster creation and drawing. Used by gui.py.
```

## Installation

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Aykut551/SpotifyPosterMaker.git
    cd SpotifyPosterMaker
    ```
    
    
2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    
    ```
    
    python -m venv venv
    
    source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
    
    venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
    
    ```
    
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
4.  **Set Up Spotify API Credentials (Required for Spotify Search):**
    
    -   This step is **only necessary if you want to use the "Spotify Search" feature** to find albums online. If you only plan to use the "Local JSON File" option, you can skip this step.
        
    -   Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/ "null") and create an application.
        
    -   Get your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
        
    -   In the project's root directory, create a new file named `.env`.
        
    -   Copy the content from `.env.example` into your new `.env` file.
        
    -   Replace the placeholder values in your `.env` file with your actual `Client ID` and `Client Secret`:
        
        ```
        SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
        SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET        
        ```
        
    -   Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being uploaded to GitHub (important for security).
        
5.  **Add Font Files:**
    
    -   Place the `.otf` or `.ttf` font files used for poster drawing into the `fonts/` directory. Ensure they match the names specified in the `fonts` dictionary in `poster_core.py`.
        

## Running the Application

To run the application, open your terminal, navigate to the project's root directory, and execute the following command:

```
streamlit run gui.py
```

This command will start the Streamlit application and open it in your default web browser.

## Usage

1.  Once the application opens in your browser, you can select the **Language** from the sidebar.
    
2.  **Select Data Source:** Choose between searching Spotify or uploading a local JSON file.
    
3.  If you choose Spotify search, enter the album name and select one from the found albums.
    
4.  If you choose a local JSON file, upload a JSON file in the appropriate format.
    
5.  Select the source for the album cover: automatic download from URL (if available) or uploading a local image file.
    
6.  Use the **Poster Options** in the sidebar to adjust the poster size, tracks per column, tracklist horizontal position, and include copyright information.
    
7.  After setting the options, click the **Create Poster** button.
    
8.  The generated poster will be displayed on the screen. Click the **Download Poster** button to download the poster in PNG format.
    

## Multi-language Support

The application supports multiple languages by loading text strings from `.lang` files in the `lang/` directory.

To add a new language:

1.  Create a new `.lang` file in the `lang/` directory (e.g., `fr.lang` for French).
    
2.  Add translated strings for all keys found in the other `.lang` files, using the `key=value` format.
    
3.  Open the `languages.py` file.
    
4.  Add your new language and file path to the `LANGUAGES` dictionary:
    
    ```
    LANGUAGES = {
        "EnglishðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸": "lang/en.lang",
        "TÃ¼rkÃ§eðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·": "lang/tr.lang",
        "FranÃ§aisðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·": "lang/fr.lang" # Added new language
    }
    
    
    
    ```
    
5.  Restart the application, and the new language will appear in the language selection box in the sidebar.
